Here is the Test tasks.
For all test cases please mark the time used for solving it.
If you will fail on some task, it is OK, just let us know. 
In case you have questions, we will answer them with pleasure.

  
### Test No. 1. Some logical task
 
Generate a random text in a separate fail (generated fail should be added, content is irrational, encoding UTF-8). PHP script has to read the text and replace each word in it, position of which is divided by 3 without a remainder by word -THREE-, then replace each word in it, position of which is divided by 5 without a remainder by word -FIVE-, and if position of the word is divided by both 3 and 5 without a reminder, replace it by word -FIFTEEN-. After running the script result has to be saved in a separate fail. 


### Test No. 2. Some debugging task

Given the program file_manager.php (see email attach), which works as a file browser (shows what files and directories are in the same directory as the program). However, for unknown reasons, the script in the file file_manager.php begins to slow down very much with a large number of files (more than 20). It is necessary for you to determine which function is working slowly, and to specify exactly what is so negatively affecting the running time of the program.
 
Briefly explain afterwards how the solution was found.
